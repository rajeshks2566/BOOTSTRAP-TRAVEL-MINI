It is used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' or 'Amba Vilas Palace' refers specifically to the one within the Old fort.</p>

It is the second highest plunge waterfall in India.[8][9] It is a segmented waterfall which depends on rain and season becomes a plunge waterfall.

            <p class="card-text">The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, burned to ashes during the 1896 marriage event (Dasara festivities). Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi commissioned the British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace.[2] Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the nearby Jaganmohan Palace. Construction was overseen by an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He conducted elaborate architectural studies during his visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, and these were used to plan the new palace. The construction cost was placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around $30 million adjusted to inflation) and the palace was completed in 1912.[3][4]
    
                The palace was further expanded in around 1930 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall wing) during the reign of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar. Although the construction was completed in 1912, the fort continued to be beautified and its inhabitants were slowly moved to newer extensions built off the palace. <br><br>The main complex is 245 ft long and 156 ft wide. There are fire extinguishing machines located in all parts of the palace in order to prevent any fires.[5] The palace has three entrances: the east gate (the front gate, opened only during the Dasara and for dignitaries), the south entrance (for the public), and the west entrance (usually opened only during the Dasara). </p>

            <p>Jog Falls is created by the Sharavati dropping 253 m (830 ft), making it the third-highest waterfall in India after the Nohkalikai Falls with a drop of 335 m (1,099 ft) in Meghalaya[11] and Dudhsagar Waterfalls with a drop of 310 m (1,020 ft) in Goa.
    
                Sharavathi, a river which rises at Ambutirtha, next to Nonabur, in the Thirthahalli taluk and takes the northwesterly course by Fatte petta, receives the Haridravati on the right below Pattaguppe and the Yenne Hole on the left above Barangi. On arriving at the frontier it bends to the west, precipitates itself down the Falls of Gersoppa, and passes that village (properly Geru-Sappe), which is some 30 kilometres (19 mi) distant, discharging into the Arabian sea at Honnavar in Uttara Kannada.[12]
                
                The Sharavati, flowing over a very rocky bed about 250 yards (230 m) wide, here reaches a tremendous chasm, 290 m (950 ft) deep, and the water comes down in four distinct falls.[13] The Raja Fall pours in one unbroken column sheer to the depth of 250 m (830 ft). Halfway down it is encountered by the Roarer, another fall, which precipitates itself into a vast cup and then rushes violently downwards to meet the Raja. A third fall, the Rocket, shoots downwards in a series of jets; while the fourth, the Rani, moves quietly over the mountainside in a sheet of foam.[14] The Tourism Department has built steps from the viewpoint to the bottom of the hill where the waterfall can be seen at the opposite side. There are approximately 1400 steps built to reach the bottom of the hill</p>
